# Varencode
## A compression method inspired by Google's `varint`s
##### Implementation by Gaspard Th√©venon

Here is my implementation of a compression method. You should
- check this out : https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding, read at least the first part
- Read include/varencode.h

Then, to use it, you can use the shared lib libs/libvarencode.so and headers in include/. You can also use printbin.so and printbin.h.

I'll add more things in this file later !
